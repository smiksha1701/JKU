Hello ðŸ™‚

as promised on Sunday evening, the MORE team talked to the University sports offer department (its called USI) and there is the possibility to join the courses which are not fully booked out yet (green = spaces left, red =fully booked out). Just have a look on the [program](https://usi.jku.at/usiweb/myusi.kurse?suche_in=go&sem_id_in=2022S&sp_id_in=&kursbez_in=&kursleiter_in=&wt_in=&uhrzeit_von_in=&uhrzeit_bis_in=&suche_kursstaette_id_in=&kursnr_in=) (sorry its only in german, but maybe google translate and other students here can help).


If you are interested in a course, just mail the USI team to: usi@jku.at (name, enrolment number if you already have, and mention that you are from Ukraine). The sports offer should be for free for you. But please get in touch with the USI team first, instead of just going to the course.
