Dear people,

we realised that not so many of you applied for Ernst Mach Scholarship. Since this is a really good opportunity to get financial support hiaaer in Austria, we would like to help you to apply for the scholarship.

Therefore we decided to offer you a group appointment, where you can come and we can apply together.

Time: 24.05.2022, 17:15-18:45

Place: Room K 012D (in Keplerbuilding)


Regarding the fact that K 012D room is room set up with computers, we have a limited number of people we can work with: 20. For that reason, we have to ask you to register beforehand by sending an email to: carina.kobler@jku.at. As usual who sends first the email, gets the spot.

If we see that there are more then 20 people who registered, we will find a solution.

If you have some questions regarding the organisation of the meeting, please write an email to: carina.kobler@jku.at. Content related questions are going to be answered at the meeting.
