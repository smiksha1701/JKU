Dear all, 

In this message I will let you know how housing will work starting this fall. The 6-month period from March to August had to goal to assist you with getting settled. I am very grateful to both student dorm organizations - Studentenwerk and WIST - that they opened up their spaces for you. But now it is time that you make transition into the regular system. 

Before I do that one important info: If you receive Ernst-Mach-Scholarship (e.g. starting in May) you still need to transfer 150 Euro each month to the respective dorm until End of August. Ernst-Mach replaces Grundversorgung. And you need to let your contact person at Caritas (or Volkshilfe) know once you get the Ernst-Mach scholarship. If you neither receive Ernst-Mach or you are rejected by Grundversorgung/Caritas - then let me (thomas.gegenhuber@jku.at), more@jku.at and the respective dorm know!!

# Apply for space
To have a space for September 1st 2022 and onwards you need to apply for a space in a regular way. 

Studentenwerk (Raab Heim/Hagenberg) already send out e-mails asking whether you want to stay there, in case you have not responded yet, please fill in the forms you received with E-Mail in May and send it back to office.linz@studentenwerk.at. Please also send an e-mail to this address if you have not received the forms. [Here is the link](https://www.studentenwerk.at/linz/en/register/)

[For WIST Dorms this is the link](https://wistooe.at/en/)

Both Studentenwerk and WIST have cheaper room options (e.g. double rooms in the Raab Heim, the single rooms with shared toilet/bath in WIST dorm JW-Kleinstraße). If you want to be in a double room you need to them know who your roomie should be. 

Note that it is of course easier if stay within the same dorm organization. The less changes the better. 

Of course your prior payment track record (e.g. transferring the 150 Euro rent support money of Grundversorgung that you received or 150 Euro out of the Ernst-Mach Scholarship) to the respective dorms matters for your applications. That being said, the dorms know that they payout process of Grundversorgung takes time and even when you receive the money there are some errors (particularly regarding the month of April). 

You should apply for dorm place as early as possible! Ideally you finish this application by end of June.

# Costs for student dorms and deposit

Both dorms will charge the regular price (!) starting September 1st. Being in the regular system also means that you need to pay a deposit. If you run into problems into paying the deposit you need to let the respective student dorm organization know via e-mail with a justification, e.g. lack of funds/scholarship, or scholarship insufficient for doing large payment (office.linz@studentenwerk.at or office@wistooe.at). If you write the student dorms regarding this matter, make sure to write all necessary infos in the e-mail (your name, for what room you applied, explanation of your situation, etc.). Adhere to an expected friendly and professional e-mail etiquette.

I also want to say that even when you pay full price it does not automatically mean that you will get your preferred choice in each of the dorms. 

For those living in Hagenberg, this new application round gives you the opportunity to apply for a dorm space in Linz. [Here is the link](https://www.studentenwerk.at/linz/en/register/)

One note: Some are still waiting for response; but many of you already successfully applied for the Ernst Mach Grant (some only got three months, but you can extend that once you successfully enrolled for a regular program) – for those who did not applied yet – do so as early as possible (so you are able to cover costs for living). More@jku.at can help with applying for Ernst-Mach-Scholarship.

# Cancellation of contract
Some of you may wonder: what if I am not staying for the full term? Usually, you need to let the dorms know if you want to cancel the contract one month prior to your departure. But both dorms understand that you are facing many hardships, so on a case-by-case basis it can be less. Nevertheless, you need to let them know as early as possible!

# Hardships 
What if you don’t get the Ernst Mach Grant and face financial hardships and worry whether you can afford the dorm. You need to let more@jku.at know so we get an overview of the situation. Explain your situation and provide documentation. In the winter term you can also apply for the social funds for emergency of the local student union (it is not the same as the emergency fund of the federal student union). To apply for this fund, you need to get in touch with sozialreferat@oeh.jku.at. In any case, for those facing hardships we will work on individual solutions.
